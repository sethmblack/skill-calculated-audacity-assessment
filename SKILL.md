# Calculated Audacity Assessment

Evaluate whether a bold move is warranted vs. a conventional approach, balancing risk with potential reward.

---

## When to Use

- Considering a risky but potentially high-reward move
- Deciding between safe conventional path and bold alternative
- Others advise caution but you sense opportunity
- Stakes are high and decision is irreversible
- User asks "Should I take this risk?" or "Is boldness warranted?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| bold_move | Yes | The audacious action being considered |
| conventional_alternative | No | The safer, standard approach |
| stakes | No | What's at risk if the bold move fails |
| reward | No | What's gained if the bold move succeeds |

## Workflow
Napoleon's audacity was legendary, but it was calculated, not reckless. Before Austerlitz, he calculated that enemies would attack his deliberately weakened right flank, then crushed them when they did. Before Ulm, he calculated that enemies could not react to a speed of advance they believed impossible.

Bold moves succeed when the calculation is correct. They fail when boldness substitutes for thought.

### Step 1: Calculated Audacity vs. Recklessness

**Calculated Audacity:**
- Based on accurate assessment of opponent/situation
- Exploits a real weakness or blind spot
- Has a plan for execution, not just the idea
- Accounts for what happens if it fails
- Speed and commitment are part of the plan

**Recklessness:**
- Based on hope, desperation, or ego
- Ignores or dismisses real risks
- Assumes success without planning execution
- No fallback if it fails
- "Fortune favors the bold" as cope, not strategy

### Step 2: The Six Tests for Calculated Audacity

#### Test 1: Opponent Expectation
Does the bold move exploit what the opponent expects you NOT to do?

- If they expect caution, boldness surprises
- If they expect boldness, caution might be the audacious move
- The bold move must genuinely catch them off-guard

#### Test 2: Information Advantage
Do you know something they don't (or believe something they won't)?

- Better intelligence enables calculated risk
- Seeing what others miss creates opportunity
- If you have no information advantage, why do you think you're right?

#### Test 3: Execution Feasibility
Can you actually execute the bold move with the resources you have?

- Audacity without capability is delusion
- Speed requirements must be realistic
- Every step must be achievable

#### Test 4: Failure Recovery
If the bold move fails, can you survive the consequences?

- What's the worst case?
- Is there a point of no return?
- What's your fallback position?

#### Test 5: Conventional Failure Mode
What happens if you take the conventional path?

- Sometimes "safe" is not actually safe
- Slow failure is still failure
- Conventional path may have its own risks

#### Test 6: Commitment Possibility
Can you commit fully, or will you hedge?

- Half-audacity is worse than no audacity
- Bold moves require total commitment
- If you'll second-guess mid-execution, don't start

## Critical Questions

1. **Why do you think this will work?** Be specific, not hopeful.
2. **What would have to be true for this to fail?** List the failure conditions.
3. **What does the opponent expect?** And why will you surprise them?
4. **Can you afford to be wrong?** Honestly?
5. **What happens if you don't act boldly?** Is conventional really safer?

| Conventional Failure Mode | [Analysis] | [Score] |
| Commitment Possibility | [Analysis] | [Score] |

**Total Score: [X/60]**

### Recommendation: [BOLD MOVE / CONVENTIONAL / MODIFIED BOLD MOVE]

### Rationale
[Why this recommendation given the analysis]

### If Bold Move Proceeds
- **Critical success factors:** [What must go right]
- **Timeline:** [How fast this must happen]
- **Commitment requirements:** [What must be all-in]
- **Exit points:** [When to abandon if it's not working]

### If Conventional Path Proceeds
- **What to watch for:** [Signs bold move would have worked]

## Decision Thresholds

| Score | Recommendation |
|-------|---------------|
| 50-60 | Bold move strongly indicated |
| 40-49 | Bold move likely warranted, verify weak tests |
| 30-39 | Caution warranted, consider modified approach |
| Below 30 | Conventional path recommended |

---

## Constraints

- Never recommend audacity based on hope alone
- Never recommend audacity when failure is not survivable
- Never recommend caution just because audacity feels uncomfortable
- Never assume the conventional path is actually safe

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "I'm a VP at a large company. I've been offered a CEO role at a risky startup. The startup has traction but uncertain funding runway. I have a comfortable, secure path at my current company. Should I take the leap?"

**Output:**

## Calculated Audacity Assessment

### The Situation
- **Bold move under consideration:** Leave VP role for startup CEO position
- **Conventional alternative:** Stay VP, continue climbing at current company
- **Stakes:** Career security, compensation, professional reputation, possibly financial security
- **Potential reward:** CEO title, equity upside, leadership challenge, potential breakout success

### The Six Tests

| Test | Assessment | Score (1-10) |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Opponent Expectation | No direct opponent; market/timing is the "enemy" - your current employer likely expects you to stay; this move would demonstrate capabilities they may not know you have | 6 |
| Information Advantage | You know the startup's real state through the interview process; you know your own capabilities better than the market does; you may see something in the startup others don't | 7 |
| Execution Feasibility | You have VP-level experience; CEO role is a step up but not a fantasy; question is whether you can execute in startup environment with resource constraints | 6 |
| Failure Recovery | If startup fails in 2-3 years, you have VP track record to fall back on; you're likely still employable at senior level; financial impact depends on your savings/burn rate | 7 |
| Conventional Failure Mode | Staying VP has its own risks: ceiling may be closer than you think; you may never get a CEO shot; regret compounds; company's future is not guaranteed either | 8 |
| Commitment Possibility | This requires full commitment - CEO cannot hedge; if you'd keep one foot in big-company mindset, you'd fail; are you ready to be all-in? | ? |

**Total Score: 34-42/60 (depending on commitment answer)**

### Recommendation: CONDITIONAL BOLD MOVE

### Rationale

The tests favor the bold move moderately, with key uncertainty around commitment. The conventional path's "safety" is illusory - staying VP forever has real costs (ceiling, regret, limited growth). Your failure recovery is strong - a 2-3 year startup CEO experience, even at a failed startup, often leads to better opportunities than staying VP.

**The critical question is commitment:** Can you go all-in on the startup, or will you protect yourself psychologically and operationally in ways that undermine your leadership? If you cannot commit fully, do not go.

### If Bold Move Proceeds
- **Critical success factors:**
  - Secure funding runway clarity before accepting (know exactly how long you have)
  - Negotiate equity that reflects the risk you're taking
  - Enter with a clear 100-day plan
  - Burn your boats mentally - no "if this doesn't work out" planning

- **Timeline:**
  - Decision: This week
  - Transition: 4-6 weeks maximum
  - First results expected: 6 months

- **Commitment requirements:**
  - Tell yourself: "I am a startup CEO now. I am not a VP taking a break."
  - Inform your network that this is your path, not an experiment
  - Accept that you may work harder than ever for less money for years

- **Exit points:**
  - If funding runs out and cannot be renewed: 6-month runway is the warning signal
  - If founder relationship becomes untenable: don't wait for it to destroy the company

### If Conventional Path Proceeds
- **What to watch for:**
  - Startup succeeds and you feel regret
  - You hit a ceiling at current company and can't move past it
  - Someone else takes the CEO role and makes it work

- **When to reconsider:**
  - Another opportunity comes at a stage-appropriate company
  - Your financial position strengthens (more runway for risk)
  - Current company shows signs of decline

### The Napoleonic Maxim

"Death is nothing, but to live defeated and inglorious is to die daily." The question is not whether this is risky - all meaningful moves are. The question is whether you can live with yourself if you don't take it. If the answer is no, the calculation has already been made.
